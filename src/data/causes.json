These terms are in no way aimed at restricting those rights. <br/> <br/> These Terms of Service indicate the techno-human relationship between you and Ssebowa. They don’t create any legal rights for other people, societies or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under them. <br/> <br/> To make these terms easy to understand, we have selected examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be accessible in your region. <br/> <br/> If these terms clash with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern that service. <br/> <br/> If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. <br/> <br/> If you violate these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don't take action right away, that doesn’t imply we're giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future. <br/> <br/> We may update these terms and service-specific other terms; to reflect changes in our services or how we do business. For instance,  we might add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones)  for legal, regulatory or security reasons, or to prevent abuse or harm. <br/> <br/> If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except when we launch a new service or feature, in urgent situations, such as curbing ongoing misuse, violation, abuse or responding to illegal requirements. <br/> <br/> If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your agreement by stopping to use our services. <br/> <br/> Apart from these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read and understand better how we run our website"
