Soil erosion could reduce crop yields by up to 10 per cent by 2050, which is equivalent to taking millions of acres of productive land away from agriculture. When the world loses soil, food supply, drinking water and biodiversity are also threatened. </br>The good news is that trees and forests have an important role to play in preventing the loss of topsoil through soil erosion. If you have ever noticed dark brown floodwater, you have seen soil erosion in practice. Soil can also be eroded by wind action and when it is damaged by livestock. Trees prevent soil erosion in several ways: They intercept rainfall which stops ‘splash erosion’, they reduce the amount of water in soil through transpiration, their roots bind soil to sloping ground, they break the wind, preventing it from blowing soil away. </p>", "<div class='blog-details-list'><p><b> Goal </b> <i class='fa fa-angle-double-right mx-2'></i>100000 trees</p><p><b> Planted </b> <i class='fa fa-angle-double-right mx-2'></i>20000 pads a month</p></div>", "<div class='blog-qutation w-50'><p>10% Planted </p></div>", "<div class='blog-details-grid'><div class='row mb-n7'>"]
